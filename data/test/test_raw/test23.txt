Chile secured a hard-fought 3-1 victory over Australia in Cuiaba to move level on points with Group B leaders the Netherlands. Early strikes from Alexis Sanchez and Jorge Valdivia put the South Americans well in control and, though Tim Cahill's header got the Socceroos back into the game, Jean Beausejour sealed victory in injury-time.

Led by a vocal support, it took just 12 minutes for Chile to break the deadlock, with a somewhat scrambled move being polished off by a familiar source. Good feet from Charles Aranguz drew Maty Ryan out of his goal, and when Eduardo Vargas's header fell at the feet of Sanchez, the Barcelona man made no mistake.

That defensive lapse may have been playing on the minds of the Australians, as two minutes later Chile had doubled their lead through Valdivia. A burst of pace and flicked pass from Sanchez found the Palmeiras man on the edge of the area, with his lobbed effort kissing the bar on its way over Ryan.

Chile dominated possession thereafter and Australia began to look demoralised by the quick-fire double. But with ten minutes of the half remaining, the experienced Cahill halved the deficit, out-jumping Gary Medel to meet a superb deep cross from Ivan Franjic.

They nearly repeated Chile's trick, as Leckie's cute pass found Cahill again, though Bravo was at the ready to save well with his feet. Jason Davidson produced the heroics at the other end too, as Mauricio Isla dallied when through, allowing the left-back to make a last-ditch tackle.

Chile remained dangerous but Australia had regained their confidence, and Cahill saw a second header denied for offside after the break. Then fellow veteran Mark Bresicano went close, with his volley drawing a fine Bravo save.

The below-par Arturo Vidal departed, but Chile's continuing threat was underlined as a defence-splitting Sanchez pass found Vargas, who nudged the ball beyond Ryan, only for Alex Wilkinson to hook off the line.

Chile probed for a goal to seal the victory, but the final ball and finish were lacking until substitute Jean Beausejour pounced on Mauricio Pinilla's rebound to fire in from the edge of the box in stoppage-time.
