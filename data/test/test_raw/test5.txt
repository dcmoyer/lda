The eastern wolf (Canis lycaon), also known as the Great Lakes wolf, eastern timber wolf, Algonquin wolf or deer wolf[2] is a canid native to the northeastern side of North America's Great Lakes region.[3] It is a medium-sized species which, like the red wolf, is of a reddish-brown coloration and is intermediate in size between the coyote and gray wolf. It primarily preys on white-tailed deer, but may occasionally attack moose and beaver.[4][5]
The eastern wolf's taxonomic identity has been the subject of controversy, with numerous different theories having been presented as to its origin, including that it is a subspecies of gray wolf,[1] that it is conspecific with the red wolf,[6][7] that it is a result of gray wolf-coyote hybridization,[8] and that it is a unique species.[6][9] As of 2005,[1] the eastern wolf is still recognized as a gray wolf subspecies by MSW3, though was classed as a distinct species by United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 2013 after a comprehensive review of several genetic studies. These studies indicate that the eastern wolf evolved in North America, unlike the gray wolf which originated in Eurasia, and diverged from a common ancestor with the coyote and red wolf 150,000â€“300,000 years ago.[9]
It is currently listed as Special Concern under the Canadian Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife (COSEWIC) and with the Committee on the Status of Species at Risk in Ontario (COSSARO), on account of its extensive hybridization with both gray wolves and coyotes. The eastern wolf is particularly susceptible to hybridization, due to its close relationship to the coyote and its ability to bridge gene flow between both coyotes and gray wolves. Furthermore, human persecution over a period of 400 years caused a population decline which reduced the number of suitable mates, thus facilitating coyote gene swamping into the eastern wolf population. Aside from posing a threat to a unique species, the resulting eastern wolf-coyote hybrids are too small in size to substitute pure eastern wolves as apex predators of moose and deer. The main nucleus of pure eastern wolves is currently concentrated within Algonquin Provincial Park.[10]
