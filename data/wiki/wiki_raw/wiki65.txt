     Istanbul (;  ) is the largest city in Turkey, constituting the countrys economic, cultural, and historical heart. Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia, with its commercial and historical centre lying on the European side and about a third of its population living on the Asian side of Eurasia. With a population of , the city forms the largest urban agglomeration in Europe as well as the largest in the Middle East, and the sixth-largest city proper in the world. Istanbuls vast area of  is coterminous with Istanbul Province, of which the city is the administrative capital. Istanbul straddles the Bosphorus strait in northwestern Turkey, between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea.  Founded on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660 BC as Byzantium, the city now known as Istanbul developed to become one of the most significant cities in history. For nearly sixteen centuries following its reestablishment as Constantinople (; ) or New Rome (; ) in 330 AD, it served as an imperial capital for the Roman and Byzantine (3301204 and 12611453), the Latin (12041261), and the Ottoman (14531922) empires. It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times, before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate.  Istanbuls strategic position along the historic Silk Road, rail networks to Europe and the Middle East, and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have helped foster an eclectic populace, although less so since the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923. Overlooked for the new capital during the interwar period, the city has since regained much of its prominence. The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s, as migrants from across Anatolia have flocked to the metropolis and city limits have expanded to accommodate them. Arts festivals were established at the end of the 20th century, while infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network.  Approximately  foreign visitors arrived in Istanbul in 2012, two years after it was named a European Capital of Culture, making the city the worlds fifth-most-popular tourist destination. The citys biggest draw remains its historic center, partially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and its cultural and entertainment hub can be found across the citys natural harbor, the Golden Horn, in the Beyolu district. Considered a global city, Istanbul is one of the fastest-growing metropolitan economies in the world. It hosts the headquarters of many Turkish companies and media outlets and accounts for more than a quarter of the countrys gross domestic product. Hoping to capitalize on its revitalization and rapid expansion, Istanbul bid for the Summer Olympics five times in twenty years.  Toponymy  The first known name of the city is Byzantium (, Byzntion), the name given to it at its foundation by Megarean colonists around 660 BC. He also attempted to promote the name Nova Roma and its Greek version   Nea Rom (New Rome), but this did not attain widespread usage. Constantinople remained the most common name for the city in the West until the establishment of the Turkish Republic, and Kostantiniyye (Ottoman Turkish ) and Istanbul were the names used alternatively by the Ottomans during their rule. Nevertheless, the use of Constantinople to refer to the city during the Ottoman period (from the mid-15th century) is now considered politically incorrect, even if not historically inaccurate, by Turks.  By the 19th century, the city had acquired a number of other names used by either foreigners or Turks. Europeans used Constantinople to refer to the whole of the city, but used the name Stamboulas the Turks also didto describe the walled peninsula between the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara. Pera (from the Greek word for across) was used to describe the area between the Golden Horn and the Bosphorus, but Turks also used the name Beyolu (today the official name for one of the citys constituent districts). Islambol (meaning either City of Islam or Full of Islam) was sometimes colloquially used to refer to the city, and was even engraved on some Ottoman coins, but the belief that it was the precursor to the present name, stanbul, is belied by the fact that the latter existed well before the former and even predates the Ottoman conquest of the city.  The name stanbul (, colloquially ) is commonly held to derive from the Medieval Greek phrase  (pronounced ), which means to the city. This reflected its status as the only major city in the vicinity, much in the same way people today often colloquially refer to their nearby urban centres as the City. An alternative view is that the name evolved directly from the name Constantinople, with the first and third syllables dropped. In modern Turkish, the name is written as stanbul, with a dotted , as the Turkish alphabet distinguishes between a dotted and dotless I. Also, while in English the stress is on the first syllable (Is), in Turkish it is on the second syllable (tan). stanbul was officially adopted as the sole name of the city in 1930. A person from the city is an stanbullu (plural: stanbullular), although Istanbulite is used in English.  History    Neolithic artifacts, uncovered by archaeologists at the beginning of the 21st century, indicate that Istanbuls historic peninsula was settled as far back as the 7th millennium BC. That early settlement, important in the spread of the Neolithic Revolution from the Near East to Europe, lasted for almost a millennium before being inundated by slightly rising water levels. Before the archaeological discovery, conventional wisdom held that Thracian tribes, including the Phrygians, began settling on the Sarayburnu in the late 6th millennium BC. On the Asian side, artefacts originating around the 4th millennium BC have been found in Fikirtepe (within Kadky). The same location was the site of a Phoenician trading post at the beginning of the 1st millennium BC as well as the town of Chalcedon, which was established around 680 BC.  However, the history of Istanbul generally begins around 660 BC, when Greek settlers from Megara established Byzantium on the European side of the Bosphorus. The settlers proceeded to build an acropolis adjacent to the Golden Horn on the site of the early Thracian settlements, fueling the nascent citys economy. The city experienced a brief period of Persian rule at the turn of the 5th century BC, but the Greeks recaptured it during the Greco-Persian Wars. Byzantium then continued as part of the Athenian League and its successor, the Second Athenian Empire, before ultimately gaining independence in 355 BC. Long allied with the Romans, Byzantium officially became a part of the Roman Empire in 73 AD.  Byzantiums decision to side with the usurper Pescennius Niger against Roman Emperor Septimius Severus cost it dearly; by the time it surrendered at the end of 195 AD, two years of siege had left the city devastated. Still, five years later, Severus began to rebuild Byzantium, and the city regainedand, by some accounts, surpassedits previous prosperity.  Rise and fall of Constantinople    Constantine the Great effectively became the emperor of the whole of the Roman Empire in September 324. Two months later, Constantine laid out the plans for a new, Christian city to replace Byzantium. As the eastern capital of the empire, the city was named Nea Roma; however, most simply called it Constantinople, a name that persisted into the 20th century. Six years later, on 11 May 330, Constantinople was proclaimed the capital of an empire that eventually became known as the Byzantine Empire or Eastern Roman Empire.  The establishment of Constantinople served as one of Constantines most lasting accomplishments, shifting Roman power eastward as the city became a centre of Greek culture and Christianity. During most of the Middle Ages, the latter part of the Byzantine era, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city on the European continent and at times the largest in the world.  Constantinople began to decline after the Fourth Crusade, during which it was sacked and pillaged. The city subsequently became the center of the Latin Empire, created by Catholic crusaders to replace the Orthodox Byzantine Empire. However, the Latin Empire was short-lived, and the Byzantine Empire was restored, albeit weakened, in 1261. Constantinoples churches, defenses, and basic services were in disrepair, and its population had dwindled to a hundred thousand from up to half a million during the 8th century.  Various economic and military policies instituted by Andronikos II, such as the reduction of military forces, weakened the empire and left it more vulnerable to attack. In the mid-14th century, the Ottoman Turks began a strategy of taking smaller towns and cities over time, cutting off Constantinoples supply routes and strangling it slowly. Finally, on 29 May 1453, after an eight-week siege (during which the last Roman emperor, Constantine XI, was killed), Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror captured Constantinople and declared it the new capital of the Ottoman Empire. Hours later, the sultan rode to the Hagia Sophia and summoned an imam to proclaim the Islamic creed, converting the grand cathedral into an imperial mosque due to the citys refusal to surrender peacefully. Mehmed declared himself as the new Kaysar-i Rm (the Ottoman Turkish equivalent of Caesar of Rome) and the Ottoman state was reorganized into an empire.  Ottoman and Turkish era   Following the conquest of Constantinople, Mehmed II immediately set out to revitalize the city, by then also known as Istanbul. He urged the return of those who had fled the city during the siege, and resettled Muslims, Jews, and Christians from other parts of Anatolia. The sultan invited people from all over Europe to his capital, creating a cosmopolitan society that persisted through much of the Ottoman period. Meanwhile, Mehmed II repaired the citys damaged infrastructure, began to build the Grand Bazaar, and constructed Topkap Palace, the sultans official residence. With the transfer of the capital from Edirne (formerly Adrianople) to Constantinople, the new state was declared as the successor and continuation of the Roman Empire.    The Ottomans quickly transformed the city from a bastion of Christianity to a symbol of Islamic culture. Religious foundations were established to fund the construction of ornate imperial mosques, often adjoined by schools, hospitals, and public baths. The Ottoman Dynasty claimed the status of caliphate in 1517, with Istanbul remaining the capital of this last caliphate for four centuries. Suleiman the Magnificents reign from 1520 to 1566 was a period of especially great artistic and architectural achievement; chief architect Mimar Sinan designed several iconic buildings in the city, while Ottoman arts of ceramics, stained glass, calligraphy, and miniature flourished. The total population of Istanbul amounted to 570,000 by the end of the 18th century.  A period of rebellion at the start of the 19th century led to the rise of the progressive Sultan Mahmud II and eventually to the Tanzimat period, which produced political reforms and allowed new technology to be introduced to the city. Bridges across the Golden Horn were constructed during this period, and Istanbul was connected to the rest of the European railway network in the 1880s. Modern facilities, such as a stable water network, electricity, telephones, and trams, were gradually introduced to Istanbul over the following decades, although later than to other European cities. Still, the modernization efforts were not enough to forestall the decline of the Ottoman regime.  In the early 20th century, the Young Turk Revolution deposed Sultan Abdul Hamid II and a series of wars plagued the ailing empires capital. The last of these, World War I, resulted in the British, French, and Italian occupation of Constantinople. The final Ottoman sultan, Mehmed VI, was exiled in November 1922; the following year, the occupation of Constantinople ended with the signing of the Treaty of Lausanne and the recognition of the Republic of Turkey, declared by Mustafa Kemal Atatrk.  In the early years of the republic, Istanbul was overlooked in favor of Ankara, selected as Turkeys capital to distance the new, secular country from its Ottoman history. However, starting from the late 1940s and early 1950s, Istanbul underwent great structural change, as new public squares, boulevards, and avenues were constructed throughout the city, sometimes at the expense of historical buildings. The population of Istanbul began to rapidly increase in the 1970s, as people from Anatolia migrated to the city to find employment in the many new factories that were built on the outskirts of the sprawling metropolis. This sudden, sharp rise in the citys population caused a large demand for housing development, and many previously outlying villages and forests became engulfed into the metropolitan area of Istanbul.  Geography       Istanbul is located in north-western Turkey within the Marmara Region on a total area of . The Bosphorus, which connects the Sea of Marmara to the Black Sea, divides the city into a European, Thracian sidecomprising the historic and economic centersand an Asian, Anatolian side. The city is further divided by the Golden Horn, a natural harbor bounding the peninsula where the former Byzantium and Constantinople were founded. The confluence of the Sea of Marmara, the Bosphorus, and the Golden Horn at the heart of present-day Istanbul has deterred attacking forces for thousands of years and still remains a prominent feature of the citys landscape.  Following the model of Rome, the historic peninsula is said to be characterized by seven hills, each topped by imperial mosques. The easternmost of these hills is the site of Topkap Palace on the Sarayburnu. Rising from the opposite side of the Golden Horn is another, conical hill, where the modern Beyolu district is situated. Because of the topography, buildings in Beyolu were once constructed with the help of terraced retaining walls, and roads were laid out in the form of steps. skdar on the Asian side exhibits similarly hilly characteristics, with the terrain gradually extending down to the Bosphorus coast, but the landscape in emsipaa and Ayazma is more abrupt, akin to a promontory. The highest point in Istanbul is amlca Hill, with an altitude of . The northern half of Istanbul has a higher mean elevation compared to the south coast, with locations surpassing , and some coasts with steep cliffs resembling fjords, especially around the northern end of the Bosporus, where it opens up to the Black Sea.  Istanbul is situated near the North Anatolian Fault, close to the boundary between the African and Eurasian Plates. This fault zone, which runs from northern Anatolia to the Sea of Marmara, has been responsible for several deadly earthquakes throughout the citys history. Among the most devastating of these seismic events was the 1509 earthquake, which caused a tsunami that broke over the walls of the city and killed more than 10,000 people. More recently, in 1999, an earthquake with its epicenter in nearby zmit left 18,000 people dead, including 1,000 people in Istanbuls suburbs. The people of Istanbul remain concerned that an even more catastrophic seismic event may be in the citys near future, as thousands of structures recently built to accommodate Istanbuls rapidly increasing population may not have been constructed properly. Seismologists say the risk of a 7.6-magnitude or greater earthquake striking Istanbul by 2030 is more than .   Climate     According to the KppenGeiger classification system, Istanbul has a borderline Mediterranean climate (Csa), humid subtropical climate (Cfa) and oceanic climate (Cfb), due to its location in a transitional climatic zone. Since precipitation in summer months, ranges from , depending on location, the city cannot be classified as solely Mediterranean or humid subtropical. Due to its size, diverse topography, maritime location and most importantly having a coastline to two different bodies of water to the north and south, Istanbul exhibits microclimates. Northern half of the city, as well as the Bosporus coastline, express characteristics of oceanic and humid subtropical climates, because of humidity from the Black Sea and the relatively high concentration of vegetation. The climate in the populated areas of the city to the south, located on the Sea of Marmara, is warmer, drier and less affected by humidity. The annual precipitation in the northern half can be twice as much (Baheky, 1166.6 mm), than it is in the southern, Marmara coast (Florya 635.0 mm). There is a significant difference between annual mean temperatures between the north and south coasts as well, Baheky , Kartal . Parts of the province, that are away from both seas exhibit considerable continental influences, with much more pronounced night-day and summer-winter temperature differences. In winter some regions of the province average at or below freezing at night.  Indeed, one of the most salient characteristics of the climate in parts of Istanbul is its persistently high humidity, which reaches  most mornings. Notably dense fog events that disrupt transportation in the region, including on the Bosphorus, are perennial occurrences during the autumn and winter months, when the humidity remains high into the afternoon. The humid conditions and the fog tend to dissipate by midday during the summer months, but the lingering humidity still has the effect of exacerbating the moderately high summer temperatures. During these summer months, high temperatures average around  and rainfall is uncommon; there are only about fifteen days with measurable precipitation between June and August. Nevertheless, despite the low precipitation, the summer months also have the highest concentration of thunderstorms.  Winter is colder in Istanbul than in most other cities around the Mediterranean Basin, with low temperatures averaging . Lake-effect snow from the Black Sea is common, although difficult to forecast, with the potential to be heavy andas with the fogdisruptive to the citys infrastructure. Spring and autumn are mild, but often wet and unpredictable; chilly winds from the northwest and warm gusts from the southsometimes in the same daytend to cause fluctuations in temperature. Overall, Istanbul has an annual average of  with significant precipitation, which amounts to  per year. The highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded in the city are  and , respectively. The highest amount of rainfall recorded in a single day is , whereas the highest recorded snow cover is .         Cityscape      The Fatih district corresponds to what was, until the Ottoman conquest, the whole of the city, across from which stood the Genoese citadel of Galata. Those Genoese fortifications were largely demolished in the 19th century, leaving only the Galata Tower, to make way for northward expansion of the city. Galata is now a part of the Beyolu district, which forms Istanbuls commercial and entertainment center around Taksim Square.  Dolmabahe Palace, the seat of government during the late Ottoman period, is located in Beikta, just north of Beyolu, across from BJK nn Stadium, home to Turkeys oldest sports club. The former village of Ortaky is situated within Beikta and provides its name to the Ortaky Mosque, along the Bosphorus near the First Bosphorus Bridge. Lining the shores of the Bosphorus north of there are yals, luxurious chalet mansions originally built by 19th-century aristocrats and elites as summer homes. Farther inland, outside the citys inner ring road, are Levent and Maslak, Istanbuls primary economic centers.    During the Ottoman period, skdar and Kadky were outside the scope of urban Istanbul, serving as tranquil outposts with seaside yals and gardens. However, during the second half of the 20th century, the Asian side experienced massive urban growth; the late development of this part of the city led to better infrastructure and tidier urban planning when compared with most other residential areas in the city. Much of the Asian side of the Bosphorus functions as a suburb of the economic and commercial centers in European Istanbul, accounting for a third of the citys population but only a quarter of its employment. As a result of Istanbuls exponential growth during the 20th century, a significant portion of the city is composed of gecekondus (literally built overnight), referring to illegally constructed squatter buildings. At present, some gecekondu areas are being gradually demolished and replaced by modern mass-housing compounds. Moreover, large scale gentrification and urban renewal projects have been taking place, such as the one in Tarlaba; however, some of these projects, like the one in Sulukule, have faced criticism. The Turkish government also has ambitious plans for an expansion of the city west and northwards on the European side in conjunction with plans for a third airport and the citys Olympic bid; the new parts of the city will include four different settlements with specified urban functions, housing 1.5 million people.  Istanbul does not have a primary urban park, unlike other large cities, but it does have a number of green areas. Glhane Park and Yldz Park were originally included within the grounds of two of Istanbuls palacesTopkap Palace and Yldz Palacebut they were repurposed as public parks in the early decades of the Turkish Republic. Another park, Fethi Paa Korusu, is situated on a hillside adjacent to the Bosphorus Bridge in Anatolia, opposite Yldz Palace. Along the European side, and closer to the Fatih Sultan Mehmet Bridge, is Emirgan Park; originally a private estate belonging to Ottoman leaders, the  park is known for its diversity of plants and an annual tulip festival held since 2005. Popular during the summer among Istanbulites is Belgrad Forest, spreading across  at the northern edge of the city. The forest originally supplied water to the city and remnants of reservoirs used during Byzantine and Ottoman times still survive.    Architecture     Istanbul is primarily known for its Byzantine and Ottoman architecture, but its buildings reflect the various peoples and empires that have previously ruled the city. Examples of Genoese and Roman architecture remain visible in Istanbul alongside their Ottoman counterparts. While nothing of the architecture of the classical Greek period has survived, Roman architecture has proved to be more durable. The obelisk erected by Theodosius in the Hippodrome of Constantinople is still visible in Sultanahmet Square, while a section of the Valens Aqueduct, constructed in the late 4th century, stands relatively intact at the western edge of the Fatih district.  Early Byzantine architecture followed the classical Roman model of domes and arches, but improved upon these elements, as in the Church of the Saints Sergius and Bacchus. The oldest surviving Byzantine church in Istanbulalbeit in ruinsis the Monastery of Stoudios (later converted into the Imrahor Mosque), which was built in 454. After the recapture of Constantinople in 1261, the Byzantines enlarged two of the most important churches still extant, Chora Church and Pammakaristos Church. Still, the pinnacle of Byzantine architecture, and one of Istanbuls most iconic structures, is the Hagia Sophia. Topped by a dome  in diameter, the Hagia Sophia stood as the worlds largest cathedral for centuries, and was later converted into a mosque and, as it stands now, a museum.  Among the oldest surviving examples of Ottoman architecture in Istanbul are the Anadoluhisar and Rumelihisar fortresses, which assisted the Ottomans during their siege of the city. Over the next four centuries, the Ottomans proceeded to make an indelible impression on the skyline of Istanbul, building towering mosques and ornate palaces. The largest palace, Topkap, includes a diverse array of architectural styles, from Baroque inside the Harem, to its Neoclassical style Endern Library. The imperial mosques include Fatih Mosque, Bayezid Mosque, Yavuz Selim Mosque, Sleymaniye Mosque, Sultan Ahmed Mosque (the Blue Mosque),  and Yeni Mosque, all of which were built at the peak of the Ottoman Empire, in the 16th and 17th centuries. In the following centuries, and especially after the Tanzimat reforms, Ottoman architecture was supplanted by European styles. An example of which is the imperial Nuruosmaniye Mosque. Areas around stiklal Avenue were filled with grand European embassies and rows of buildings in Neoclassical, Renaissance Revival and Art Nouveau styles, which went on to influence the architecture of a variety of structures in Beyoluincluding churches, stores, and theatersand official buildings such as Dolmabahe Palace.  Administration    Since 2004, Istanbul has been one of only two cities in Turkey (the other being zmit) whose city boundaries are concurrent with the boundaries of its province. The city, considered capital of Istanbul Province, is administered by the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (MMI), which oversees the 39 districts of the city-province.  The current city structure can be traced back to the Tanzimat period of reform in the 19th century, before which Islamic judges and imams led the city under the auspices of the Grand Vizier. Following the model of French cities, this religious system was replaced by a mayor and a citywide council composed of representatives of the confessional groups (millet) across Istanbul. Beyolu was the first area of the city to have its own director and council, with members instead being longtime residents of the neighborhood. Laws enacted after the Ottoman constitution of 1876 aimed to expand this structure across the city, imitating the twenty arrondissements of Paris, but they were not fully implemented until 1908, when Istanbul was declared a province with nine constituent districts. This system continued beyond the founding of the Turkish Republic, with the province renamed a belediye (municipality), but the municipality was disbanded in 1957.    Small settlements adjacent to major population centers in Turkey, including Istanbul, were merged into their respective primary cities during the early 1980s, resulting in metropolitan municipalities. The main decision-making body of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality is the Municipal Council, with members drawn from district councils.  The Municipal Council is responsible for citywide issues, including managing the budget, maintaining civic infrastructure, and overseeing museums and major cultural centers.    Meanwhile, district councils are chiefly responsible for waste management and construction projects within their respective districts. They each maintain their own budgets, although the metropolitan mayor reserves the right to review district decisions. One-fifth of all district council members, including the district mayors, also represent their districts in the Municipal Council. All members of the district councils and the Municipal Council, including the metropolitan mayor, are elected to five-year terms. Representing the Justice and Development Party, Kadir Topba has been Mayor of Istanbul since March 2004.  With the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality and Istanbul Province having equivalent jurisdictions, few responsibilities remain for the provincial government. Similar to the MMI, the Istanbul Special Provincial Administration has a governor, a democratically elected decision-making bodythe Provincial Parliamentand an appointed Executive Committee. Mirroring the executive committee at the municipal level, the Provincial Executive Committee includes a secretary-general and leaders of departments that advise the Provincial Parliament. The Provincial Administrations duties are largely limited to the building and maintenance of schools, residences, government buildings, and roads, and the promotion of arts, culture, and nature conservation. Hseyin Avni Mutlu has been Governor of Istanbul Province since May 2010.   Demographics    Throughout most of its history, Istanbul has ranked among the largest cities in the world. By 500 AD, Constantinople had somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 people, edging out its predecessor, Rome, for worlds largest city. Constantinople jostled with other major historical cities, such as Baghdad and Changan, for the position of worlds most populous city until the 13th century. While it never returned to being the worlds largest, it remained Europes largest city from not long after the Fall of Constantinople until the start of the 19th century, when it was surpassed by London. Today, it still forms one of the largest urban agglomerations in Europe, alongside Moscow.  The Turkish Statistical Institute estimates that the population of Istanbul was 14,160,467 on 31 December 2013, making it the largest city in Turkey, with  of the countrys population. Because of its vast land area, Istanbul is among the five most populous cities proper in the world, even though its metropolitan arearoughly equivalent to the city properranks below fifteenth. The citys annual population growth of  ranks as the highest among the seventy-eight largest metropolises in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The high population growth mirrors an urbanization trend across the country, as the second- and third-fastest growing OECD metropolises are the Turkish cities of zmir and Ankara.  Istanbul experienced especially rapid growth during the second half of the 20th century, with its population increasing tenfold between 1950 and 2000. This growth in population comes, in part, from an expansion of city limitsparticularly between 1980 and 1985, when the number of Istanbulites nearly doubled. The remarkable growth was, and still is, largely fueled by migrants from eastern Turkey seeking employment and improved living conditions. The number of residents of Istanbul originating from seven northern and eastern provinces is greater than the populations of their entire respective provinces; notably, Sivas and Kastamonu each account for more than half a million residents of Istanbul. Istanbuls foreign population, by comparison, is very small, amounting to just 42,228 residents in 2007. Only  of the citys residents are originally from Istanbul.  Religious and ethnic groups     Istanbul has been a cosmopolitan city throughout much of its history, but it has become more homogenized since the end of the Ottoman Empire. Still, most of Turkeys religious and ethnic minorities remain concentrated in Istanbul. The vast majority of people across Turkey, and in Istanbul, consider themselves Muslim, and more specifically members of the Sunni branch of Islam. Most Sunnis follow the Hanafi school of Islamic thought, although approximately  of Sunnis follow the Shafii school. The largest non-Sunni Muslim sect, accounting for  Turks, is the Alevis; a third of all Alevis in the country live in Istanbul. Mystic movements, like Sufism, were officially banned after the establishment of the Turkish Republic, but they still boast numerous followers.   The Patriarch of Constantinople has been designated Ecumenical Patriarch since the 6th century, and has subsequently come to be widely regarded as the leader of the worlds  Orthodox Christians. Since 1601, the Patriarchate has been based in Istanbuls Church of St. George. Into the 19th century, the Christians of Istanbul tended to be either Greek Orthodox or members of the Armenian Apostolic Church. Because of a number of events during the 20th centuryincluding the 1923 population exchange between Greece and Turkey, a 1942 wealth tax, and the 1955 Istanbul riotsthe Greek population, originally centered in Fener and Samatya, has decreased substantially. At the start of the 21st century, Istanbuls Greek population numbered just 3,000 (down from 130,000 in 1923 and 260,000 according to the Ottoman Census of 1910 of 850,000 total). There are today between 50,000 and  in Istanbul, down from 164,000 in 1913. Christians made up half the population of the city in 1910.  The largest ethnic minority in Istanbul is the Kurdish community, originating from eastern and southeastern Turkey. Although the Kurdish presence in the city dates back to the early Ottoman period, the influx of Kurds into the city has accelerated since the beginning of the KurdishTurkish conflict with the Kurdistan Workers Party (i.e. since the late 1970s). About two to three million residents of Istanbul are Kurdish, meaning there are more Kurds in Istanbul than in any other city in the world. The neighborhood of Balat used to be home to a sizable Sephardi Jewish community, first formed during the period of the Spanish Inquisition. Romaniotes and Ashkenazi Jews resided in Istanbul even before the Sephardim, but their proportion has since dwindled; today, just  of Istanbuls Jews are Ashkenazi. In large part due to emigration to Israel, the Jewish population nationwide dropped from 100,000 in 1950 to just 18,000 in 2005, with the majority of them living in either Istanbul or zmir. Levantines, Latin Christians who settled in Galata during the Ottoman period, played a seminal role in shaping the culture and architecture of Istanbul during the 19th and early 20th centuries; their population has dwindled, but they still remain in the city in small numbers.  Politics   Istanbul has voted for the winning party in general elections since 1995. Since 2002, the right-wing Justice and Development Party (AKP) has won pluralities in every general and local election. The citys electorate has also voted in favour for the AKP governments constitutional reforms proposed during the 2007 and 2010 constitutional referenda. Turkish President and former AKP Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoan was elected Mayor of stanbul in the 1994 local elections as the Islamist Welfare Party candidate with 25.1% of the vote, winning due to a vote split between the mainstream centrist parties. Conservative parties traditionally find support in older districts with high population densities such as Baclar, Fatih, Sultanbeyli and Esenler. Meanwhile, the opposition Kemalist centre-left Republican Peoples Party (CHP), currently the second major political force in both stanbul and the country, gets most of its support from more rural districts such as Silivri, atalca and Saryer. However, notable urban districts such as Beikta, Bakrky, ili and Kadky have returned strong support for the CHP in past elections. The CHP are generally strongest in the west, where newer residential developments are taking place. stanbul has 39 districts, more than any other province in Turkey. Since stanbul is Turkeys largest city and has usually voted in the same way as the country as a whole, it is largely perceived in Turkish politics that the winning party of an election is essentially decided by stanbuls electorate. Political parties thus allocate substantial amounts of electoral campaign funds and to winning control of the stanbul Metropolitan Municipality. Due to its electoral importance, stanbul has reported the largest and most serious cases of electoral fraud in recent elections, most notably during the 2014 local elections.    The incumbent mayor of the city is Kadir Topba of the AKP, who was first elected in the 2004 local elections and succeeded Ali Mfit Grtuna of the closed down Welfare Party. He was re-elected in 2009 and 2014. The leader of the CHP and parliamentary opposition, Kemal Kldarolu, ran against Topba in the 2009 local elections. He is currently a Member of Parliament for stanbul. Between 2007 and 2014, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoan was also an MP for stanbul. For general elections, the city is divided into 3 electoral districts and returns 85 MPs to the Turkish parliament. In the 2014 presidential election, 49.83% of the citys electorate voted for AKP candidate Recep Tayyip Erdoan. Although Erdoan won the most votes in stanbul, his failure to win above 50% was seen as significant. Opposition candidate Ekmeleddin hsanolu came second with 41.08% while the HDP pro-Kurdish and left-wing candidate Selahattin Demirta won a substantial 9.09%. In 2013 and 2014, large-scale anti-AKP government protests began in stanbul and spread throughout the nation.  Economy    With a PPP-adjusted gross domestic product of , Istanbul ranked 29th among the worlds urban areas in 2011. Since the mid-1990s, Istanbuls economy has been one of the fastest growing among OECD metro-regions. According to Foreign Policy and the McKinsey Global Institute, Istanbul will register the 14th-highest absolute GDP growth among world cities by 2025, with a nominal increase of . Istanbul is responsible for  of Turkeys GDP, with  of the countrys industrial labor force residing in the city. That includes the taxes of 37 billionaires based in Istanbul, the fifth-highest number among cities around the world.  As expected for a city of its size, Istanbul has a diverse industrial economy, producing commodities as varied as olive oil, tobacco, transport vehicles, and electronics. Despite having a focus on high-value-added work, its low-value-added manufacturing sector is substantial, representing just  of Istanbuls GDP, but four-fifths of the citys total exports. In 2005, companies based in Istanbul produced exports worth  and received imports totaling ; these figures were equivalent to  and , respectively, of the national totals.  Istanbul is home to Borsa Istanbul, the sole exchange entity of Turkey, which combined the former Istanbul Stock Exchange, the Istanbul Gold Exchange, and the Derivatives Exchange of Turkey. The former Istanbul Stock Exchange  was originally established as the Ottoman Stock Exchange in 1866. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Galata was the financial center of the Ottoman Empire, where the Ottoman Stock Exchange was located. Bankalar Caddesi continued to be Istanbuls main financial district until the 1990s, when most Turkish banks began moving their headquarters to the modern central business districts of Levent and Maslak. In 1995, the Istanbul Stock Exchange (now Borsa Istanbul)  moved to its current building in the stinye quarter of the Saryer district. A new central business district is also under construction in Ataehir and will host the headquarters of various Turkish banks and financial institutions upon completion.   As the only sea route between the oil-rich Black Sea and the Mediterranean, the Bosphorus is one of the busiest waterways in the world; more than  tonnes of oil pass through the strait each year, and the traffic on the Bosphorus is three times that on the Suez Canal. As a result, there have been proposals to build a canal, known as Canal Istanbul, parallel to the strait, on the European side of the city. Istanbul has three major shipping portsthe Port of Haydarpaa, the Port of Ambarl, and the Port of Zeytinburnuas well as several smaller ports and oil terminals along the Bosphorus and the Sea of Marmara. Haydarpaa, situated at the southeastern end of the Bosphorus, was Istanbuls largest port until the early 2000s. Shifts in operations to Ambarl since then have left Haydarpaa running under capacity and with plans to decommission the port. In 2007, Ambarl, on the western edge of the urban center, had an annual capacity of  TEUs (compared to 354,000 TEUs at Haydarpaa), making it the fourth-largest cargo terminal in the Mediterranean basin. The Port of Zeytinburnu is advantaged by its proximity to motorways and Atatrk International Airport, and long-term plans for the city call for greater connectivity between all terminals and the road and rail networks.  Istanbul is an increasingly popular tourist destination; whereas just  foreigners visited the city in 2000, it welcomed  foreign tourists in 2012, making it the worlds fifth most-visited city. Istanbul is Turkeys second-largest international gateway, after Antalya, receiving a quarter of the nations foreign tourists. Istanbuls tourist industry is concentrated in the European side, with  of the citys hotels located there. Low- and mid-range hotels tend to be located on the Sarayburnu, while higher-end hotels are primarily located in the entertainment and financial centers north of the Golden Horn. Istanbuls seventy museums, the most visited of which are the Topkap Palace Museum and the Hagia Sophia, bring in  in revenue each year. The citys environmental master plan also notes that there are , , and  of historical significance in Istanbul.  Culture    Istanbul was historically known as a cultural hub, but its cultural scene stagnated after the Turkish Republic shifted its focus toward Ankara. The new national government established programs that served to orient Turks toward musical traditions, especially those originating in Europe, but musical institutions and visits by foreign classical artists were primarily centered in the new capital. Although much of Turkeys cultural scene had its roots in Istanbul, it was not until the 1980s and 1990s that Istanbul reemerged globally as a city whose cultural significance is not solely based on its past glory.  By the end of the 19th century, Istanbul had established itself as a regional artistic center, with Turkish, European, and Middle Eastern artists flocking to the city. Despite efforts to make Ankara Turkeys cultural heart, Istanbul had the countrys primary institution of art until the 1970s.  The first film screening in Turkey was at Yldz Palace in 1896, just a year after the technology publicly debuted in Paris. Movie theaters rapidly cropped up in Beyolu, with the greatest concentration of theaters being along the street now known as stiklal Avenue. Istanbul also became the heart of Turkeys nascent film industry, although Turkish films were not consistently developed until the 1950s. Since then, Istanbul has been the most popular location to film Turkish dramas and comedies. While  the Turkish film industry ramped up in the second half of the century, it was not until Uzak (2002) and My Father and My Son (2005), both filmed in Istanbul, that the nations movies began to see substantial international success. Istanbul and its picturesque skyline have also served as a backdrop for a number of foreign films, including Topkapi (1964), The World Is Not Enough (1999), and Mission Istaanbul (2008).  Coinciding with this cultural reemergence was the establishment of the Istanbul Festival, which began showcasing a variety of art from Turkey and around the world in 1973. From this flagship festival came the International Istanbul Film Festival and the Istanbul International Jazz Festival in the early 1980s. With its focus now solely on music and dance, the Istanbul Festival has been known as the Istanbul International Music Festival since 1994. The most prominent of the festivals that evolved from the original Istanbul Festival is the Istanbul Biennial, held every two years since 1987. While its early incarnations were aimed at showcasing Turkish visual art, it has since opened to international artists and risen in prestige to become among the elite biennales, alongside the Venice Biennale and the So Paulo Art Biennial.  Leisure and entertainment  Istanbul has numerous shopping centers, from the historic to the modern. The Grand Bazaar, in operation since 1461, is among the worlds oldest and largest covered markets. stinye Park in stinye and Zorlu Center near Levent are among the newest malls which include the stores of the worlds top fashion brands. Abdi peki Street in Nianta and Badat Avenue on the Anatolian side of the city have evolved into high-end shopping districts.    Aside from typical Turkish cuisine like kebab, Istanbul is also famous for its historic seafood restaurants. Many of the citys most popular and upscale seafood restaurants line the shores of the Bosphorus (particularly in neighborhoods like Ortaky, Bebek, Arnavutky, Yeniky, Beylerbeyi and engelky), while the Kumkap neighborhood along the Sea of Marmara has a pedestrian zone that hosts around fifty fish restaurants. The Princes Islands,  from the city center, are also popular for their seafood restaurants. Because of their restaurants, historic summer mansions, and tranquil, car-free streets, the Princes Islands are a popular vacation destination among Istanbulites and foreign tourists.  Restaurants featuring foreign cuisines are mainly concentrated in the Beyolu, Beikta, ili and Kadky districts. Residing along stiklal Avenue is the iek Pasaj, now home to winehouses (known as meyhanes), pubs, and restaurants. While the focus of stiklal Avenue, originally famous for its taverns, has shifted toward shopping, the nearby Nevizade Street is still lined with winehouses and pubs. Some other neighborhoods around stiklal Avenue have recently been revamped to cater to Beyolus nightlife, with formerly commercial streets now lined with pubs, cafs, and restaurants playing live music. Other focal points for Istanbuls nightlife include Nianta, Ortaky, Bebek, and Kadky.  Sports     Istanbul has some of Turkeys oldest sports clubs. Beikta J.K., established in 1903, is considered the oldest of these sports clubs; because of its initial status as Turkeys only club, it occasionally played as the national team. While its football team has seen several periods of dominance in national competition, Istanbuls Galatasaray S.K. and Fenerbahe S.K. have fared better in international competition and tie for the honor of winning the most Sper Lig championships. Istanbul has six basketball teamsAnadolu Efes S.K., Beikta, Darafaka Dou, Fenerbahe lker, Galatasaray Liv Hospital and stanbul Bykehir Belediyesporthat play in the premier-level Turkish Basketball League.  Many of Istanbuls sports facilities have been built or upgraded since 2000 to bolster the citys bids for the Summer Olympic Games. Atatrk Olympic Stadium, the largest multi-purpose stadium in Turkey, was completed in 2002 as an IAAF first-class venue for track and field. The stadium hosted the 2005 UEFA Champions League Final and remains the home field of stanbul Bykehir Belediyespor. kr Saracolu Stadium, Fenerbahes home field, hosted the 2009 UEFA Cup Final three years after its completion, and Trk Telekom Arena opened in 2011 to replace Ali Sami Yen Stadium as Galatasarays home turf. All three stadiums are elite Category 4 (formerly five-star) UEFA stadiums.    The Sinan Erdem Dome, among the largest indoor arenas in Europe, hosted the final of the 2010 FIBA World Championship, the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships, and the 201112 Euroleague Final Four. Prior to the completion of the Sinan Erdem Dome in 2010, Abdi peki Arena was Istanbuls primary indoor arena, having hosted the finals of EuroBasket 2001. Several other indoor arenas, including the Beikta Akatlar Arena, have also been inaugurated since 2000, serving as the home courts of Istanbuls sports clubs. The most recent of these is the 13,800-seat lker Sports Arena, which opened in 2012 as the home court of Fenerbahes basketball teams. Despite the construction boom, five bids for the Summer Olympicsin 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2020and national bids for UEFA Euro 2012 and UEFA Euro 2016 have ended unsuccessfully.  Istanbul Park was a stop on the World Touring Car Championship circuit and the European Le Mans Series in 2005 and 2006, but the track has not seen either of these competitions since then. Between its opening in 2005 and 2011, Istanbul Park also hosted the annual Turkish Grand Prix; its future remains uncertain due to financial troubles. The Istanbul Sailing Club, established in 1952, hosts a number of races, showcases, and events on the waterways in and around Istanbul each year. The Turkish Offshore Racing Club also hosts major races, with its most prestigious being its race for the Marine Forces Trophy. Istanbul was also an occasional stop on the F1 Powerboat World Championship circuit, although its last appearance on the Bosphorus was in 2000.  Media  While most state-run radio and television stations are based in Ankara, Istanbul is the primary hub of Turkish media. The industry has its roots in the former Ottoman capital, where the first Turkish newspaper, Takvim-i Vekayi (Calendar of Affairs), was published in 1831. The Caalolu street on which the newspaper was printed, Bb- li Street, rapidly became the center of Turkish print media, alongside Beyolu across the Golden Horn.  Today, Istanbul hosts a wide variety of periodicals. Most nationwide newspapers are based in Istanbul, with simultaneous Ankara and zmir editions.   Radio broadcasts in Istanbul date back to 1927, when Turkeys first radio transmission came from atop the Central Post Office in Eminn. Control of this transmission, and other radio stations established in the following decades, ultimately came under the state-run Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT), which held a monopoly on radio and television broadcasts between its founding in 1964 and 1990. Istanbuls airwaves are the busiest in Turkey, primarily featuring either Turkish-language or English-language content. One of the rare exceptions, offering both, is Ak Radyo (94.9 FM). Among Turkeys first private stations, and the first featuring foreign popular music, was Istanbuls Metro FM (97.2 FM). The state-run , although based in Ankara, also features English-language popular music, while English-language news programming is provided on NTV Radyo (102.8 FM).  TRT-Children is the only TRT television station based in Istanbul. Regardless, Istanbul is home to the headquarters of a number of Turkish stations and regional headquarters of international media outlets. Istanbul-based Star TV was the first private television network to be established following the end of the TRT monopoly; Star TV and Show TV (also based in Istanbul) remain highly popular throughout the country, airing Turkish and American series. Samanyolu TV, Kanal D, and ATV are other stations in Istanbul that offer a mix of news and series, while NTV (partnered with U.S. media outlet MSNBC) and Sky Turkboth based in the cityare mainly just known for their news coverage in Turkish. The BBC has a regional office in Istanbul, assisting its Turkish-language news operations, while American news channel CNN established the Turkish-language CNN Trk there in 1999. The Istanbul-based business and entertainment channel CNBC-e began broadcasting in 2000.  Education     Istanbul University, founded in 1453, is the oldest Turkish educational institution in the city. Although originally an Islamic school, the university established law, medicine, and science departments in the 19th century and was secularized after the founding of the Turkish Republic. Istanbul Technical University, founded in 1773 as the Royal School of Naval Engineering, is the worlds third-oldest university dedicated entirely to engineering sciences. These public universities are two of just eight across the city; other prominent state universities in Istanbul include the Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University, which served as Turkeys primary institution of art until the 1970s, and Marmara University, the countrys third-largest institution of higher learning.  While the most established universities in Istanbul are backed by the government, the city has a number of prominent private institutions. The first modern private university in Istanbul, also the oldest American school still in existence in its original location outside the United States, was Robert College, founded by Christopher Robert, a wealthy American and a philanthropist, and Cyrus Hamlin, a missionary devoted to education, in 1863. The tertiary element of its education program has become the public Boazii University in 1971, while the remaining portion in Arnavutky continues as a boarding high-school under the name Robert College. Today, there are at least 30 private universities in the city, including Istanbul Commerce University and Kadir Has University. A new biomedical research and development hub, called Bio Istanbul, is under construction in Baakehir, and will host 15,000 residents, 20,000 working commuters, and a university upon completion.  In 2007, there were about 4,350 schools, about half of which were primary schools; on average, each school had 688 students. In recent years, Istanbuls educational system has expanded substantially; from 2000 to 2007, the number of classrooms and teachers nearly doubled and the number of students increased by more than . Galatasaray High School, established in 1481 as the Galata Palace Imperial School, is the oldest high school in Istanbul and the second-oldest educational institution in the city. It was built at the behest of Sultan Bayezid II, who sought to bring students with diverse backgrounds together as a means of further strengthening his growing empire. It is one of Turkeys Anatolian High Schools, elite public high schools that place a stronger emphasis on instruction in foreign languages. Galatasaray, for example, offers instruction in French, while other Anatolian High Schools primarily teach in English or German alongside Turkish. The city also has foreign high schools, such as Liceo Italiano, that were established in the 19th century to educate foreigners.  A few of Istanbuls other high schools are notable for their styles of teaching or entrance requirements. Kuleli Military High School, located along the shores of the Bosphorus in engelky, and Turkish Naval High School, located on one of the Princes Islands, are military high schools, complemented by three military academiesthe Turkish Air Force, Turkish Military, and Turkish Naval Academies. Another important school in Istanbul is Darafaka High School, which provides free education to children across the country missing at least one parent. Darafaka begins instruction with the fourth grade, providing instruction in English and, starting in sixth grade, a second foreign languageGerman or French. Other prominent high schools in the city include Kabata Erkek Lisesi (founded in 1908) and Kadky Anadolu Lisesi (founded in 1955).  Public services     Istanbuls first water supply systems date back to the citys early history, when aqueducts (such as the Valens Aqueduct) deposited the water in the citys numerous cisterns. In later years, with the aim of responding to the ever-increasing public demand, water from various springs was channeled to public fountains, like the Fountain of Ahmed III, by means of supply lines. Today, Istanbul has a chlorinated and filtered water supply and a sewage treatment system managed by the Istanbul Water and Sewerage Administration (SK).  The Silahtaraa Power Station, a coal-fired power plant along the Golden Horn, was the sole source of Istanbuls electricity between 1914, when its first engine room was completed, and 1952. The state-run Turkish Electrical Authority (TEK) brieflybetween its founding in 1970 and 1984held a monopoly on the generation and distribution of electricity, but now the authoritysince split between the Turkish Electricity Generation Transmission Company (TEA) and the Turkish Electricity Distribution Company (TEDA)competes with private electric utilities.   The Ottoman Ministry of Post and Telegraph was established in 1840 and the first post office, the Imperial Post Office, opened near the courtyard of Yeni Mosque. By 1876, the first international mailing network between Istanbul and the lands beyond the vast Ottoman Empire had been established. Of course, Istanbuls telecommunications infrastructure has developed substantially in the century since. GSM cellular networks arrived in Turkey in 1994, with Istanbul among the first cities to receive the service. Postal services remain under the purview of what is now the Post and Telegraph Organization (retaining the acronym PTT).  In 2000, Istanbul had , of which 100 were private. Turkish citizens are entitled to subsidized healthcare in the nations state-run hospitals. As public hospitals tend to be overcrowded or otherwise slow, private hospitals are preferable for those who can afford them. Their prevalence has increased significantly over the last decade, as the percentage of outpatients using private hospitals increased from  to  between 2005 and 2009. Many of these private hospitals, as well as some of the public hospitals, are equipped with high-tech equipment, including MRI machines, or associated with medical research centers. Turkey has more hospitals accredited by the U.S.-based Joint Commission than any other country in the world, with most concentrated in its big cities. The high quality of healthcare, especially in private hospitals, has contributed to a recent upsurge in medical tourism to Turkey (with a  increase between 2007 and 2008 alone). Laser eye surgery is particularly common among medical tourists, as Turkey is known for specializing in the procedure.  Transportation    Istanbuls primary motorways are the , , , and . The O-1 forms the citys inner ring road, traversing the Bosphorus Bridge, and the O-2 is the citys outer ring road, crossing the Fatih Sultan Mehmet (Second Bosphorus) Bridge. The O-2 continues west to Edirne and the O-4 continues east to Ankara; the O-2, O-3, and O-4 are coterminous with European route E80 (the Trans-European Motorway) between Portugal and the TurkishIranian border.   Istanbuls local public transportation system is a complex network of trams, funiculars, metro lines, buses, bus rapid transit, and ferries. Fares across modes are integrated, using the contactless Istanbulkart, introduced in 2010, or the older Akbil electronic ticket device. Trams in Istanbul date back to 1872, when they were horse-drawn, but even the first electrified trams were decommissioned in the 1960s. The Tnel opened in 1875 as the worlds second-oldest subterranean rail line (after Londons Metropolitan Railway). It still carries passengers between Karaky and stiklal Avenue along a steep  track, while a more modern funicular between Taksim Square and Kabata began running in 2006.    The Istanbul Metro comprises three lines currently in operation (the M1 and M2 on the European side, and the M4 on the Asian side) with several other lines (such as the M3, M5, M7, and M6 Mini-Metro) and extensions currently under construction. The two sides of Istanbuls metro are connected under the Bosphorus with the Marmaray tunnel, inaugurated in 2013 as the first rail connection of any kind between Thrace and Anatolia. With the Marmarays completion, rail use in the city is expected to increase to  (from just ), behind only Tokyo and New York City. Until then, buses provide transportation within and between the two halves of the city, accommodating  passenger-trips each day. The Metrobus, a form of bus rapid transit, traverses the Bosphorus Bridge, with dedicated lanes leading to its termini. DO (Istanbul Seabuses) runs a combination of all-passenger ferries and car-and-passenger ferries to ports on both sides of the Bosphorus, as far north as the Black Sea. With additional destinations around the Sea of Marmara, DO runs the largest municipal ferry operation in the world. The citys main cruise ship terminal is the Port of Istanbul in Karaky, with a capacity of 10,000 passengers per hour. While most visitors enter Istanbul by air, about half a million foreign tourists enter the city by sea each year.    International rail service from Istanbul launched in 1889, with a line between Bucharest and Istanbuls Sirkeci Terminal, which ultimately became famous as the eastern terminus of the Orient Express from Paris. Regular service to Bucharest and Thessaloniki continued until the early 2010s, when the former was interrupted for Marmaray construction and the latter was halted due to economic woes in Greece. After Istanbuls Haydarpaa Terminal opened in 1908, it served as the western terminus of the Baghdad Railway and an extension of the Hejaz Railway; today, neither service is offered directly from Istanbul. Service to Ankara and other points across Turkey is normally offered by Turkish State Railways, but construction of Marmaray and the Ankara-Istanbul high-speed line forced the station to close in 2012. Private bus companies instead operate routes alongand well beyondthose offered by the rail network. Istanbuls main bus station is the largest in Europe, with a daily capacity of  and , serving destinations as far as Frankfurt.   Istanbul has two international airports, the larger of which is Istanbul Atatrk. Atatrk, located  west of the city center, handled  passengers in 2013, making it the fifth-busiest airport in Europe and the eighteenth-busiest in the world. Because of the traffic at Istanbuls current airports, however, environmental concerns have also been raised with respect to the plans for a third airport. Currently under construction, the new (third) international airport of Istanbul will become the largest airport in the world upon the completion of all four stages of the project, with a capacity to serve 150 million passengers per annum.
