   Eagle is a common name for many large birds of prey of the family Accipitridae; it belongs to several groups of genera that are not necessarily closely related to each other.  Most of the sixty species of eagles are from Eurasia and Africa. Outside this area, just fourteen species can be found  two in North America, nine in Central and South America, and three in Australia.  Description  Eagles are large, powerfully built birds of prey, with a heavy head and beak. Even the smallest eagles, like the booted eagle (Aquila pennata) (which is comparable in size to a common buzzard (Buteo buteo) or red-tailed hawk (B. jamaicensis)), have relatively longer and more evenly broad wings, and more direct, faster flight  despite the reduced size of aerodynamic feathers. Most eagles are larger than any other raptors apart from some vultures. The smallest species of eagle is the South Nicobar serpent eagle (Spilornis klossi), at 450 g (1 lb) and 40 cm (16 in). The largest species are discussed below. Like all birds of prey, eagles have very large hooked beaks for tearing flesh from their prey, strong muscular legs, and powerful talons. The beak is typically heavier than that of most other birds of prey. Eagles eyes are extremely powerful, having up to 3.6 times human acuity for the martial eagle, which enables them to spot potential prey from a very long distance. This keen eyesight is primarily attributed to their extremely large pupils which ensure minimal diffraction (scattering) of the incoming light. The female of all known species of eagle is larger than the male.  Eagles normally build their nests, called eyries, in tall trees or on high cliffs. Many species lay two eggs, but the older, larger chick frequently kills its younger sibling once it has hatched. The dominant chick tends to be the female, as they are bigger than the male. The parents take no action to stop the killing.  Due to the size and power of many eagle species, they are ranked at the top of the food chain as apex predators in the avian world. The type of prey varies from genus to genus. The Haliaeetus and Ichthyophaga eagles prefer to capture fish, though the species in the former often capture various animals, especially other water birds, and are powerful kleptoparasites of other birds. The snake and serpent eagles of the genera Circaetus, Terathopius and Spilornis predominantly prey on the great diversity of snakes that are found in the tropics of Africa and Asia. The eagles of the genus Aquila are often the top birds of prey in open habitats, taking almost any medium-sized vertebrate they can catch. Where Aquila eagles are absent, other eagles, such as the buteonine black-chested buzzard-eagle of South America, may assume the position of top raptorial predator in open areas. Many other eagles, including the species-rich Spizaetus genus, live predominantly in woodlands and forest. These eagles often target various arboreal or ground-dwelling mammals and birds, which are often unsuspectingly ambushed in such dense, knotty environments. Hunting techniques differ among the species and genera, with some individual eagles having engaged in quite varied techniques based their environment and prey at any given time. Most eagles grab prey without landing and take flight with it so the prey can be carried to a perch and torn apart. Authors on birds David Allen Sibley, Pete Dunne and Clay Sutton, described the behavioral difference between hunting eagles and other birds of prey thus (in this case the bald and golden eagles as compared to other North American raptors):  <blockquote> They have at least one singular characteristic. It has been observed that most birds of prey look back over their shoulders before striking prey (or shortly thereafter); predation is after all a two-edged sword. All hawks seem to have this habit, from the smallest kestrel to the largest Ferruginous  but not the Eagles. </blockquote>  Among the eagles are some of the largest birds of prey: only the condors and some of the Old World vultures are markedly larger. It is regularly debated which should be considered the largest species of eagle. They could be measured variously in total length, body mass or wingspan. Different lifestyle needs among various eagles result in variable measurements from species to species. For example, many forest-dwelling eagles, including the very large harpy and Philippine eagles, have relatively short wingspans, a feature necessary for being able to maneuver in quick, short bursts through dense forested habitats. On the other hand, eagles in the genus Aquila are found almost strictly in open country, are superlative soarers, and have relatively long wings for their size.  Here are lists of the top five eagles going on weight, length and, lastly, wingspan. Unless otherwise noted via reference, the figures listed are the median reported for each measurement in the guide Raptors of the World (Ferguson-Lees, et al.), in which only measurements that could be personally verified by the authors were listed.        Distribution * Nearctic (USA and Canada): golden eagle (also found in Palearctic), bald eagle * Neotropical (Central and South America): Spizaetus (4 species), solitary eagles (2 spp.), harpy eagle, crested eagle, black-chested buzzard-eagle * Australasian ** Australia: wedge-tailed eagle (range extends into southern New Guinea), white-bellied sea-eagle (range extends into Asia), little eagle ** New Guinea: Papuan eagle, white-bellied sea-eagle, pygmy eagle  Groups Eagles are often informally divided into four groups.  The snake eagles are placed in the subfamily Circaetinae. The fish eagles, booted eagles, and harpy eagles have traditionally been placed in the subfamily Buteoninae together with the buzzard-hawks (buteonine hawks) and harriers. Some authors may treat these groups as tribes of the Buteoninae; Lerner &amp; Mindell proposed separating the eagle groups into their own subfamilies of Accipitridae.  Fish eagles Sea eagles or fish eagles take fish as a large part of their diets, either fresh or as carrion.  Proposed subfamily Haliaeetinae. Genera: Haliaeetus, Ichthyophaga.  Some authors include Gypohierax angolensis, the vulturine fish eagle (also called the palm-nut vulture) in this group. However, genetic analyses indicate it is related to a grouping of NeophronGypaetusEutriorchis (Egyptian vulture, bearded vulture (lammergeier), and Madagascan serpent eagle).  The fish eagles have a close genetic relationship with Haliastur and Milvus; the whole group is only distantly related to the Buteo group.  Booted eagles   Booted eagles or true eagles have feathered tarsi (lower legs).  Tribe Aquililae or proposed subfamily Aquilinae. Genera: Aquila, Hieraaetus; Spizaetus, Oroaetus, Spizastur; Nisaetus;  See comments under eagle species for changes to the composition of these genera.  Snake eagles Snake or serpent eagles are, as the name suggests, adapted to hunting reptiles.  * Subfamily Circaetinae. Genera: Circaetus, Spilornis, Dryotriorchis, Terathopius.  * Eutriorchis (subfamily Gypaetinae or Circaetinae).  Despite filling the niche of a snake eagle, genetic studies suggest that the Madagascan serpent eagle Eutriorchis is not related.  Harpy eagles Harpy eagles or giant forest eagles are large eagles that inhabit tropical forests. The group contains two to six species, depending on the author. Although these birds occupy similar niches, and have traditionally been grouped together, they are not all related: the solitary eagles are related to the black-hawks, and the Philippine eagle to the snake eagles.  * Harpy eagles (proposed subfamily Harpiinae) ** Harpia harpyja, harpy eagle  Central and South America. ** Morphnus guianensis, crested eagle  Central and South America. ** Harpyopsis novaeguineae, Papuan eagle  New Guinea.  * Philippine eagle ** Pithecophaga jefferyi, Philippine eagle  Philippines.  * Solitary eagles ** Crowned eagle or crowned solitary eagle, Buteogallus (formerly Harpyhaliaetus) coronatus  South America. ** Solitary eagle or montane solitary eagle, Buteogallus (formerly Harpyhaliaetus) solitarius  South America.  Species    Major new research into eagle taxonomy suggests that the important genera Aquila and Hieraaetus are not composed of nearest relatives, and it is likely that a reclassification of these genera will soon take place, with some species being moved to Lophaetus or Ictinaetus. *Bonellis eagle and the African hawk-eagle have been moved from Hieraaetus to Aquila. *Either the greater spotted eagle and lesser spotted eagle should move from Aquila to join the long-crested eagle in Lophaetus, or, perhaps better, all three of these species should move to Ictinaetus with the black eagle. *The steppe eagle and tawny eagle, once thought to be conspecific, are not even each others nearest relatives.

The origin of  is unknown, but it is believed to possibly derive from either  (meaning dark-colored, swarthy, or blackish) as a reference to the plumage of eagles or from  (meaning north wind).  Old English used the term , related to Scandinavias rn / rn. It is similar to other Indo-European terms for bird or eagle, including  (),  (), and . The Albanian word for eagle is , deriving from the root .  In Britain before 1678, eagle referred specifically to the golden eagle, with the other native species, the white-tailed eagle, being known as erne. The modern name golden eagle for aquila chrysaetos was introduced by the naturalist John Ray.  Religion and folklore   The Moche people of ancient Peru worshiped the animal and often depicted eagles in their art.  The eagle is also the patron animal of the ancient Greek god Zeus. In particular, Zeus was said to have taken the form of an eagle in order to abduct Ganymede, and there are numerous artistic depictions of the eagle Zeus bearing Ganymede aloft, from Classical times up to the present (see illustrations in the Ganymede (mythology) page.)  The United States eagle feather law stipulates that only individuals of certifiable Native American ancestry enrolled in a federally recognized tribe are legally authorized to obtain eagle feathers for religious or spiritual reasons. In Canada, the poaching of eagle feathers for the booming U.S. market has sometimes resulted in the arrests of First Nations person for the crime.  Psalm 103 mentions renewing ones youth as the eagle. Augustine of Hippo gives a curious explanation of this in his commentary on the Psalms.  The eagle is a common form in the Anglican tradition, often used to support the Bible because of the symbolism of spreading the gospel over the world. Additional symbolic meanings for eagle include the pronouncements to the Israelites in Exodus 19:4; Psalms 103:5 and Isaiah 40:31.  In Hinduism, Garuda is a lesser divinity, usually the mount (vahanam) of Vishnu.  is depicted as having the golden body of a strong man with a white face, red wings, and an eagles beak and with a crown on his head. This ancient deity was said to be massive, large enough to block out the sun.  Heraldry    Eagles are an exceptionally common symbol in heraldry, being considered the King of Birds in contrast to the lion, the King of Beasts. They are particularly popular in Germanic countries, due to their association with the Roman Empire and its claimed successor the Holy Roman Empire. The eagle of the Holy Roman Empire was two-headed, supposedly representing the two divisions, East and West, of the old Roman Empire.  Heraldic eagles are most often found displayed, i.e. with their wings and legs extended. They can also occur close, i.e. with their wings folded, or rising, i.e. about to take flight. The heads, wings, and legs of eagles can also be found independently.   *The coat of arms and flag of Albania has a black double-headed eagle. Furthermore, the eagle gives Albania its name (in Albanian Shqiperia means Land of the eagles) and Albanians call themselves shqipetar or shqipe meaning eagles. *The coat of arms of Armenia has a gold eagle and a lion. *The coat of arms of Austria has a black eagle. *The coat of arms of the Czech Republic integrates the symbols of Moravia and Silesia (both with female eagles in their emblems  red-and-white chequered and black respectively) with Bohemias lion. *The coat of arms of Egypt is a golden eagle looking towards the viewers left. It is taking from the golden Eagle of Saladin founded on Saladin Citadel of Cairo. *The coat of arms of Germany has a black eagle. *The coat of arms of Ghana has two golden eagles holding it. *The coat of arms of Iceland has an eagle holding it, as well as a dragon, a bull and a giant. *The coat of arms of Indonesia has an eagle-like garuda carrying a shield on its neck and a banner on its feet. *The coat of arms of Iraq has the golden Eagle of Saladin. ** The Coat of Arms of Kurdistan has the eagle of the Medes *The coat of arms of Mexico has a golden eagle perched upon a cactus devouring a snake. *The coat of arms of Moldova consists of a stylized eagle holding a cross in its beak and a sceptre and a branch in its claws. *The coat of arms of Montenegro represents the two-headed eagle in flight. *The coat of arms of Navarre/Basque Country Kingdom has a black eagle. *The coat of arms of Nigeria has a red eagle on top. *The coat of arms of Palestine has the golden Eagle of Saladin. *The coat of arms of Panama has a harpy eagle. *The coat of arms of the Philippines has the bald eagle of the United States as a symbol of its colonial past, but the monkey-eating eagle is the de jure national bird of the country. *The coat of arms of Poland has a white eagle with a golden beak and talons wearing a golden crown. *The coat of arms of Romania has a golden aquila holding a cross in its beak and a mace and a sword in its claws. *The coat of arms of Russia has a gold double-headed eagle. *The coat of arms of Serbia has a white bicephalic eagle of the House of Nemanji. *The coat of arms of Syria formerly had the eagle of Saladin. *The Great Seal of the United States has a bald eagle. *The coat of arms of Yemen depicts a golden eagle with a scroll between its claws. *The coat of arms of Zambia has an orange red eagle on top. *The Polish and the Serbian eagles are distinguished by their white color. Historic uses: *The Ptolemaic rulers of Egypt used it as their seal. *Napoleon I used the Roman golden eagle as the symbol of his new French empire. *Persian Empire: the symbol of the Persian Army was an eagle. *The Romans used it on the standards of their armies. From this derives: **The late Byzantine Empire chose a two-headed golden eagle as its symbol. It is popularly that one head symbolised ancient Rome, and the other head symbolized new Rome at Constantinople. From this derives: ***The two-headed eagle is the emblem of Shqipria or Land of the Eagles, which is known in English as Albania (see The Tale of the Eagle for the legendary origin of the name). ***After the fall of Constantinople, the Russian Empire took the two-headed eagle as its own symbol. **After his crowning as the new Roman Emperor, Charlemagne adopted the ancient Roman eagle as his own symbol. The Holy Roman Empire born of his kingdom took the eagle. From this derives: ***The Austrian Empire had a two-headed eagle as its symbol. After the abolition of Austria-Hungary, Austria took as its symbol a one-headed eagle in the modern coat of arms of Austria. ***Prussia, and later Germany have used a black eagle as their national symbol. ***The Spanish Catholic monarchs, Isabella and Ferdinand, used the eagle as a part of the royal shield representing Saint John the Evangelist. The eagle was again on the Spanish shield under the Francoist regime and the transition to Democracy (19391981). *The Seljuk and Ottoman Turks both used a double-headed eagle in their coats-of-arms. *During the 1930s and 1940s, Adolf Hitlers Nazi Germany used a black eagle with its wings outstretched and clutching a swastika as its insignia.
