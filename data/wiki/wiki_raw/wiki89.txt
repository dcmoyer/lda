     Ho Chi Minh City (; ), formerly named Saigon (; ), is the largest city in Vietnam. It was once known as Prey Nokor, an important Khmer sea port prior to annexation by the Vietnamese in the 17th century. Under the name Saigon, it was the capital of the French colony of Cochinchina and later of the independent republic of South Vietnam 195575. On 2 July 1976, Saigon merged with the surrounding Gia nh Province and was officially renamed Ho Chi Minh City after H Ch Minh (although the name  is still unofficially widely used).  The metropolitan area, which consists of the Ho Chi Minh City metropolitan area, Th Du Mt, D An, Bin Ha and surrounding towns, is populated by more than 9 million people,<ref group=nb>[ ng Nai Provinces Populations: 2.254.676 (2006)], [ B Ra Vng Tu Provinces Populations:862.081 (2002)], [ Bnh Dng provinces Population: 1,2 million (2007)], [ Ho Chi Minh Citys population: 5,037,155 (1999)]</ref> making it the most populous metropolitan area in Vietnam. The citys population is expected to grow to 13.9 million in 2025.  The Ho Chi Minh City Metropolitan Area, a metropolitan area covering most parts of the Southeast region plus Tin Giang Province and Long An Province under planning, will have an area of  with a population of 20 million inhabitants by 2020. According to the Mercer Human Resource Consulting, Economist Intelligence Unit and ECA International, Ho Chi Minh City is ranked 132 on the list of worlds most expensive cities for expatriate employees.  Etymology   Ho Chi Minh City has gone by several different names during its history, reflecting settlement by different ethnic, cultural and political groups. In the 1690s, Nguyn Hu Cnh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyn rulers of Hu to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the Mekong Delta and its surroundings. Control of the city and the area passed to the Vietnamese, who gave the city the official name of  (). This name remained until the time of French conquest in the 1860s, when the occupying force adopted the name Saigon for the city, a westernized form of the traditional name, although the city was still indicated as   on Vietnamese maps written in Ch Hn until at least 1891. Immediately after the communist takeover of South Vietnam in 1975, a provisional government renamed the city after H Ch Minh, the late North Vietnamese leader.<ref group=nb name=hcm-pc>  The text of the resolution is as follows: By the National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam, 6th tenure, 1st session, for officially renaming Saigon-Gia Dinh City as Ho Chi Minh City.<br> The National Assembly of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam Considering the boundless love of the people of Saigon-Gia Dinh City for President Ho Chi Minh and their wish for the city to be named after him;<br> Considering the long and difficult revolutionary struggle launched in Saigon-Gia Dinh City, with several glorious feats, deserves the honor of being named after President Ho Chi Minh;<br> After discussing the suggestion of the Presidium of the National Assemblys meeting;<br> Decides to rename Saigon-Gia Dinh City as Ho Chi Minh City.</ref> Even today, however, the informal name of Si Gn / Saigon remains in daily speech both domestically and internationally, especially among the Vietnamese diaspora. In particular, Si Gn is still commonly used to refer to District 1.   ;Saigon An etymology of Saigon (or Si Gn in Vietnamese) is that Si is a Sino-Vietnamese word (Hn t: ) meaning firewood, lops, twigs; palisade, while Gn is another Sino-Vietnamese word (Hn t: ) meaning stick, pole, bole, and whose meaning evolved into cotton in Vietnamese (bng gn, literally cotton stick, i.e., cotton plant, then shortened to gn). This name may refer to the many kapok plants that the Khmer people had planted around Prey Nokor, and which can still be seen at Cy Mai temple and surrounding areas. It may also refer to the dense and tall forest that once existed around the city, a forest to which the Khmer name, Prey Nokor, already referred.  Other proposed etymologies draw parallels from Tai-Ngon ( ), the Cantonese name of Cholon, which means embankment (French: quais),<ref group=nb name=vhs-taingon>Un sicle plus tard (1773), la rvolte des TYON (sic) <nowiki>[quclata]</nowiki> tout, dabord dans les montagnes de la province de Qui-Nhon, et stendit rapidement dans le sud, chassa de Bien-Hoa le mouvement commercial quy avaient attir les Chinois.

Francis Garnier, quoted in: </ref> and Vietnamese Sai Cn, a translation of the Khmer Prey Nokor (). Prey means forest or jungle, and nokor is a Khmer word of Sanskrit origin meaning city or kingdom, and related to the English word Nation  thus, forest city or forest kingdom.<ref group=nb name=warhope-sihanouk>The Khmer name for Saigon, by the way, is Prey Nokor; prey means forest, nokor home or city. </ref>  Truong Mealy (former director of King Norodom Sihanouks royal Cabinet), says that, according to a Khmer Chronicle, The Collection of the Council of the Kingdom, Prey Nokors proper name was Preah Reach Nokor (), Royal City; later locally corrupted to Prey kor, meaning kapok forest, from which Saigon was derived (kor meaning kapok in Khmer and Cham, going into Vietnamese as gn ).  ;Ho Chi Minh City The current official name, , abbreviated Tp. HCM, is translated as Ho Chi Minh City, abbreviated HCMC, and in French as  (the circumflex is sometimes omitted), abbreviated HCMV. The name commemorates H Ch Minh, the first leader of North Vietnam. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname (H, ) with a given name meaning enlightened will (from Sino-Vietnamese  ; Ch meaning will (or spirit), and Minh meaning light), in essence, meaning bringer of light.  History   Early history Ho Chi Minh City began as a small fishing village likely known as Prey Nokor, Forest City, or perhaps Preah Reach Nokor which, according to a Khmer Chronicle meant Royal City. The area that the city now occupies was originally swampland, and was inhabited by Khmer people for centuries before the arrival of the Vietnamese. In Khmer folklore southern Vietnam was given to the Vietnamese government as a dowry for the marriage of a Vietnamese princess to a Khmer prince in order to stop constant invasions and pillaging of Khmer villages. The early dynastical entity was the Rhead-Sivakumaran family who dominated the region in the early Romanic period, until the Qing dynasty overcame the armies of Rhead-Sivakumaran and General Behan in 820 BC.  Khmer territory Beginning in the early 17th century, colonization of the area by Vietnamese settlers gradually isolated the Khmer of the Mekong Delta from their brethren in Cambodia proper and resulted in their becoming a minority in the delta.  In 1623, King Chey Chettha II of Cambodia (161828) allowed Vietnamese refugees fleeing the TrnhNguyn civil war in Vietnam to settle in the area of Prey Nokor and to set up a custom house there. Increasing waves of Vietnamese settlers, which the Cambodian kingdom could not impede because it was weakened by war with Thailand, slowly Vietnamized the area. In time, Prey Nokor became known as Saigon. Prey Nokor was the most important commercial seaport to the Khmers. The loss of the city and the rest of the Mekong Delta cut off Cambodias access to the East Sea. Subsequently, the only remaining Khmers sea access was southwesterly at the Gulf of Thailand e.g. at Kampong Saom and Kep.  Nguyn Dynasty rule  In 1698, Nguyn Hu Cnh, a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyn rulers of Hu by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement. A large Vauban citadel called Gia nh was built, which was later destroyed by the French following the Battle of K Ha (see Citadel of Saigon).   Colonial French era  Conquered by France and Spain in 1859, the city was influenced by the French during their colonial occupation of Vietnam, and a number of classical Western-style buildings and French villas in the city reflect this. Saigon had, in 1929, a population of 123,890, including 12,100 French.  In 1931, a new rgion called <nowiki></nowiki>SagonCholon<nowiki></nowiki> and consisted of Sagon and Cholon was formed; Sagon and Cholon, meanwhile, remained separate cities with their respective mayors and municipal councils. In 1956, after South Vietnams independence from France in 1955, the rgion of SagonCholon became a single city called <nowiki></nowiki>Sagon<nowiki></nowiki> following the merger of the two cities of Sagon and Cholon.  Capital of the Republic of Vietnam The Viet Minh proclaimed independence of Vietnam in 1945 after a combined occupation by Vichy France and Japan, and before the Communist revolution in China. They were led by Ho Chi Minh. The Viet Minh-held sections of Vietnam were more concentrated in rural areas, and more in the Northern half than in the South. During this time, the US supported France in regaining its control over the country, with effective control spanning mostly in the Southern half and parts of the Red River Delta region like Hanoi, Haiphong and Thi Bnh.   Former Emperor Bo i made Saigon the capital of the State of Vietnam in 1949 with himself as head of state. In 1954, the Geneva Agreement partitioned Vietnam along the 17th parallel (Bn Hi River), with the communist Vit Minh, under Ho Chi Minh, gaining complete control of the northern half of the country, while the Saigon government continued to govern the State of Vietnam which continued in the southern half of the country and the southern half gaining independence from France. The State officially became the Republic of Vietnam when Bo i was deposed by his Prime Minister Ng nh Dim in 1955 in the referendum. Saigon and Cholon, an adjacent city with mostly Sino-Vietnamese residents, were combined into an administrative unit known as the  Thnh Si Gn (Capital City Saigon), or Th  Si Gn (National Capital Saigon). South Vietnam was a capitalist and anti-communist state which fought against the communist North Vietnamese and their allies during the Vietnam War, with the assistance of the United States and other countries. On 30 April 1975, Saigon fell and the war ended with a Communist victory.  Post-Vietnam War and today At the conclusion of the Vietnam War on 30 April 1975, the city came under the control of the Vietnamese Peoples Army. Among Vietnamese diaspora communities and particularly the U.S. (which had fought the communists), this event is commonly called the fall of Saigon, while the communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam refers to it as the Liberation of Saigon. In 1976, upon the establishment of the unified communist Socialist Republic of Vietnam, the city of Saigon (including Cholon), the province of Gia nh and two suburban districts of two other nearby provinces were combined to create Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the late Communist leader H Ch Minh. The former name Saigon is still widely used by many Vietnamese, especially in informal contexts. Generally, the term Saigon refers only to the urban districts of Ho Chi Minh City.  Geography  Ho Chi Minh City is located in the southeastern region of Vietnam,  south of Hanoi. The average elevation is  above sea level.

Total cargo transport to Ho Chi Minh Citys ports reached 50.5   million metric tonnes, nearly one-third of the total for Vietnam.   With a population now of 8,382,287 (as of Census 2010 on 1 April 2010) (registered residents plus migrant workers as well as a metropolitan population of 10 million), Ho Chi Minh City needs increased public infrastructure. To this end, the city and central governments have embarked on an effort to develop new urban centers. The two most prominent projects are the Thu Thiem city center in District 2 and the Phu My Hung Urban Area, a new city center in District 7 (as part of the Saigon South project) where various international schools such as Saigon South International School and Australias Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology. In December 2007, Phu My Hungs new City Center completed the 17.8   km 1014 lane wide Nguyen Van Linh Boulevard linking the Saigon port areas, Tan Thuan Export Processing Zone to the National Highway 1 and the Mekong Delta area. In November 2008, a brand new trade center, Saigon Exhibition and Convention Center, also opened its doors. Other projects include Grandview, Waterfront, Sky Garden, Riverside and Phu Gia 99. Phu My Hungs new City Center received the first Model New City Award from the Vietnamese Ministry of Construction.   Transport  Air  The city is served by Tn Sn Nht International Airport, the largest airport in Vietnam in terms of passengers handled (with an estimated number of over 15.5 million passengers per year in 2010, accounting for more than half of Vietnams air passenger traffic). Long Thnh International Airport is scheduled to begin operating in 2025. Based in Long Thnh District, ng Nai Province, about  northeast of Ho Chi Minh City, Long Thnh Airport will serve international flights, with a maximum traffic capacity of 100 million passengers per year when fully completed; Tn Sn Nht Airport will serve domestic flights.  Rail Ho Chi Minh City is also a terminal for many Vietnam Railways train routes in the country. The Reunification Express (tu Thng Nht) runs from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi from Saigon Railway Station in District 3, with stops at cities and provinces along the line.  Within the city, the two main stations are Sng Thn and Si Gn. In addition, there are several smaller stations such as D An, Th c, Bnh Triu, G Vp. However, rail transportation is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.  Water  The citys location on the Saigon River makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including Vng Tu, Cn Th and the Mekong Delta, and Phnom Penh. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnams southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Doi and Te Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13 million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 201114.  Coach bus Ho Chi Minh City has a number of coach houses, which house coach buses to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station  in terms of passengers handled  is the Mien Dong Coach Station in the Bnh Thnh District.  Inner city transportation   Private transport The main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have trip meters, although it is also common to agree on the trip price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. Public buses run on many routes and fare can be purchased on the bus. For short trips, xe m (literally, hug vehicle) motorcycle taxis are available where the passenger sits at the rear of a motorbike. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on cyclos, which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular. . There are approximated 340,000 cars and 3.5 million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compare to Hanoi. The growing number of motorcycles tend to cause gridlocks and pollute the air. These are two reasons why the government develops plans to reduce the number of motorcycles and to improve public transportation besides other measures to reduce traffic.  Metro system The Ho Chi Minh City Metro, a light rail rapid transit network, is currently in the preparation stages, with the first line currently under construction, to be completed by 2019. This first line will connect Bn Thnh to Sui Tin Park in District 9, with a depot in Long Binh. Planners expect the route to serve more than 160,000 passengers daily.  Society  Healthcare The health care system of the city is relatively developed with a chain of about 100 government owned hospitals or medical centers and dozens of privately owned clinics. The 1,400 bed Ch Ry Hospital, upgraded by Japanese aid and the French-sponsored Institute of Cardiology, are among the top medical facilities in Indochina.  Communications   The citys media is the most developed in the country. At present, there are seven daily newspapers: Sai Gon Giai Phong (Liberated Saigon), and its Vietnamese, investment and finance, sports, evening and weekly editions; Tui Tr (Youth), the highest circulation newspaper in Vietnam; Thanh Nien (Young Men), the second largest circulation in the south of Vietnam; Nguoi Lao Dong (Labourer); The Thao (Sports); Phap Luat (Law) and the Saigon Times Daily, the English-language newspaper as well as more than 30 other newspapers and magazines. The city has hundreds of printing and publishing houses, many bookstores and a widespread network of public and school libraries; the citys General Library houses over 1.5 mllion books. Locally based Ho Chi Minh City Television (HTV) is the second largest television network in the nation, just behind the national Vietnam Television (VTV), broadcasting 24/7 on 7 different channels (using analog and digital technology). Many major international TV channels are provided through two cable networks (SCTV and HTVC), with over one million subscribers. The Voice of Ho Chi Minh City is the largest radio station in southern Vietnam.   Internet coverage, especially through ADSL connections, is rapidly expanding, with over 2,200,000 subscribers and around 5.5 million frequent users. Internet service providers (ISPs) operating in Ho Chi Minh City include the Vietnam Data Communication Company (VDC), Corporation for Finance and Promoting Technology (FPT), Netnam Company, Saigon Post and Telecommunications Services Corporation (Saigon Postel Corporation, SPT) and Viettel Company. As in all of Vietnam, Internet access is regulated; websites containing sensitive political or religious content are routinely blocked, and certain websites have been blocked, though government officials deny that this is intentional. The city has more than two million fixed telephones and about fifteen million cellular phones (the latter growing annually by 20%). Mobile phone service is provided by a number of companies, including Viettel Mobile, MobiFone, VinaPhone, and S-Fone.  Education  Notable high schools in Ho Chi Minh City include L Hng Phong High School for the Gifted, Ph Thng Nng Khiu High School for the Gifted, Trn i Ngha High School for the Gifted, Nguyn Thng Hin High School, Nguyn Th Minh Khai High School, and Gia nh High School, L Qu n High School, among others. Though the former schools are all public, private education is also available in Ho Chi Minh City. High school consists of grade 1012 (sophomore, junior, and senior).  Higher education in Ho Chi Minh City is a burgeoning industry; the city boasts over 80 universities and colleges with a total of over 400,000 students. Notable universities include Vietnam National University with 50,000 students distributed among six schools; The University of Technology (Vietnamese: i hc Bch khoa, formerly Ph Th National Center of Technology); The University of Sciences (formerly Saigon College of Sciences)); The University of Social Sciences and Humanities (formerly Saigon College of Letters); The International University; The University of Economics and Law; and the newly established University of Information Technology.   Some other important higher education establishments include HCMC University of Pedagogy, University of Economics, University of Architecture, University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Nong Lam University (formerly University of Agriculture and Forestry), University of Law, University of Technical Education, University of Banking, University of Industry, Open University, University of Sports and Physical Education, University of Fine Arts, University of Culture, the Conservatory of Music, the Saigon Institute of Technology, Vn Lang University, Saigon University and Hoa Sen University.  In addition to the above public universities, Ho Chi Minh City is also home to several private universities. One of the most notable is RMIT International University, Vietnam, a campus of Australian public research RMIT University with an enrollment of about 6,000 students.
