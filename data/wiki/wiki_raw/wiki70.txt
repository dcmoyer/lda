      Dhaka (, ; , ; formerly known as Dacca) is the capital city of Bangladesh. It is the tenth largest city in the world, with a population of more than 18 million people in the Greater Dhaka Area. Dhaka is one of the major cities of South Asia, being Bangladeshs seat of government and an important financial and cultural centre, alongside Chittagong. It stands on the east bank of the Buriganga River in the central Bengal delta. Dhaka was historically called the City of Mosques and the Venice of the East. It is also known as the Rickshaw Capital of the World, due to its daily traffic of over 600,000 cycle rickshaws.  Dhaka is the administrative seat of an eponymous division and district. The Old City of Dhaka served as the Mughal capital of Bengal in the 17th century. It grew into a worldwide trading centre, particularly for its famed muslin industry. After a period of decline under British rule, the modern city began to develop in the late-19th century. Dhaka was the capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam between 1905 and 1911. It was the administrative capital of East Pakistan after the Partition of British India in 1947. During the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971, Dhaka emerged as the capital of an independent Bangladesh.  Modern Dhaka is one of the fastest growing megacities in the world. Although it has a diverse economy, a high literacy rate and rapidly developing infrastructure, the city faces major challenges of poverty, pollution, crime, congestion and political violence. Dhaka has seen increased foreign direct investment, leading to greater volumes of trade and commerce. Its transport system is undergoing major redevelopments, with the construction of a metro system, an elevated expressway and the Hatirjheel canal and bypass project. Dhakas acclaimed landmarks include its modernist National Capital Complex, leading museums and art galleries, the Lalbagh Fort and historic buildings in the Old City.   Etymology  The origins of the name for Dhaka are uncertain. Once dhak tree was very common in the area and the name may have originated from it. Alternatively, this name may refer to the hidden goddess Dhakeshwari, whose shrine is located in the south-western part of the city. Another popular theory states that Dhaka refers to a membranophone instrument,  dhak which was played by order of Subahdar Islam Khan I during the inaugurating of the Bengal capital in 1610. Some references also say that it was derived from a Prakrit dialect called Dhaka Bhasa; or Dhakka, used in the Rajtarangini for a watch-station; or it is the same as Davaka, mentioned in the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta as an eastern frontier kingdom.  History    The history of urban settlement in the area of modern-day Dhaka dates to the 1st century. The region was part of the ancient district of Bikrampur, which was ruled by the Buddhist Pala Empire and the Hindu Sena dynasty. Under Islamic rule, it became part of the historic district of Sonargaon, the regional administrative hub of the Delhi and the Bengal Sultanates. The Grand Trunk Road passed through the region, connecting it with North India, Central Asia and the southeastern port city of Chittagong.  The Mughal Empire conquered the region during the late 16th-century. Under Mughal rule, the Old City of Dhaka grew the banks of the Buriganga River. Township developments significantly increased its population. Dhaka was proclaimed the capital of Mughal Bengal in 1608. Islam Khan Chishti was the first administrator of the city. Khan christened it as Jahangir Nagar (City of Jahangir) in honour of the Emperor Jahangir. The name was dropped soon after the emperors death. The main expansion of the city took place under Mughal governor Shaista Khan. The city then measured 19 by 13 kilometres (12 by 8 mi), with a population of nearly one million. Dhaka was one of the largest and most prosperous cities in the Indian subcontinent. It grew into a regional economic centre during the 18th century. It was home to traders from across South Asia; as well as an Armenian community; and Persian, Arab, French, Portuguese, Dutch, English and Greek merchants. The city was a centre of the worldwide muslin industry. It had many caravanseries, including the Bara Katra.    The city passed to the control of the British East India Company in 1793. Plugged into the imperial mercantile networks of the British Empire, it continued to flourish in trade and commerce. Its riverbanks were dotted with numerous mansions, mosques, temples, bazaars and churches. Eurasian traders built neighborhoods in Farashganj (French Bazaar), Armanitola (Armenian Quarter) and Portogola (Portuguese Quarter). The rise of the British colonial capital of Calcutta caused a sharp decline in the citys population and led to stagnation during the early 19th century. In 1824, an Anglican bishop described Dhaka as a city of magnificent ruins. But substantive development and modernization eventually followed. A modern civic water system was introduced in 1874. The British Raj bestowed privileges on the Estate of the Dhaka Nawab Family, which dominated the citys political and social elite. The Dhaka Cantonment was established as a base for the British Indian Army. The British developed the modern city around Ramna, Shahbag Garden and Victoria Park. The electrcity supply began in 1901.  During the abortive Partition of Bengal in 1905, Dhaka became the capital of the short-lived province of Eastern Bengal and Assam. In 1906, the All India Muslim League was formed at the Ahsan Manzil, during a conference on liberal education hosted by Nawab Sir Khawja Salimullah. Bengal was reunited in 1911. The University of Dacca was established in 1921. It gained prestige as the Oxford of the East during its early years. DEVCO, a subsidiary of the Occtavian Steel Company, began widescale power distribution in 1930. With the Partition of British India in 1947, Dhaka became the administrative capital of East Pakistan. The citys population increased dramatically as hundreds and thousands of Muslim immigrants settled from Bengal and other parts of South Asia. The city faced severe shortages and strains on its infrastructure.  The Awami League was formed at the Rose Garden Palace in 1949. The adoption of Urdu as the sole official language of Pakistan led to the Bengali Language Movement. The movement reached its peak in 1952. On 21 February 1952, Pakisani security forces shot and killed peaceful student demonstrators in Dacca University. In the 1960s, Dhaka witnessed works by leading world architects, including Konstantinos Doxiadis and Louis Kahn. They influenced and complemented the nascent Bengali modernist movement pioneered by Muzharul Islam. Dhaka remained a hotbed of political activity, as student activism and demands for autonomy increased. The Six point movement was widely supported by the citys residents. The city had an influential press, with prominent newspapers like the  Ittefaq and the Weekly Holiday. During the political and constitutional crisis in 1971, the military junta led by Yahya Khan refused to transfer power to the newly elected National Assembly, causing mass riots, civil disobdience and a movement for self-determination. On 7 March 1971, Awami League leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman addressed a massive public gathering at the Ramna Race Course Maidan in Dhaka, in which he declared the beginning of the independence struggle. Subsequently, East Pakistan came under a non-cooperation movement against the Pakistani state. The movement saw the complete shutdown of government offices, public transport, schools and colleges. East Pakistanis stopped paying taxes and most monetary transactions and communication links with West Pakistan were suspended. On Pakistans Republic Day (23 March), Bangladeshi flags were hoisted throughout Dhaka in a show of resistance.   On 25 March 1971, the Pakistan Army launched military operations under Operation Searchlight against the population of East Pakistan. Much of the citys population was either displaced or forced to flee to the countryside. In the ensuing Bangladesh Liberation War, the Mukti Bahini launched regular guerilla attacks and ambush operations against Pakistani forces. Dhaka was struck with numerous air raids by the Indian Air Force in December. It was liberated by Bangladesh-India Allied Forces on 16 December with the surrender of Pakistan.  The post-independence period witnessed rapid growth as Dhaka attracted migrant workers from across rural Bangladesh. In August 1975, Sheikh Mujib was assassinated in a military coup. There were further coups in November 1975 and March 1985. In the 1980s, Bangladesh pioneered the formation of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) and hosted its first summit in Dhaka. A mass uprising in 1990 led to the restoration of parliamentary democracy. In the 1990s and 2000s, Dhaka saw improved economic growth and the emergence of affluent business districts and satellite towns.   Geography    Dhaka is located in central Bangladesh at , on the eastern banks of the Buriganga River. The city lies on the lower reaches of the Ganges Delta and covers a total area of . Dhaka District has an area of 1,463.60 square kilometres (565 sq mi) with a population of 18,305,671 in 2012; and is bounded by the districts of Gazipur, Tangail, Munshiganj, Rajbari, Narayanganj, Manikganj. Tropical vegetation and moist soils characterize the land, which is flat and close to sea level. This leaves Dhaka susceptible to flooding during the monsoon seasons owing to heavy rainfall and cyclones.   Climate   Dhaka experiences a hot, wet, and humid tropical climate. Under the Kppen climate classification, Dhaka has a tropical savanna climate. The city has a distinct monsoonal season, with an annual average temperature of  and monthly means varying between  in January and  in May. Increasing air and water pollution emanating from traffic congestion and industrial waste are serious problems affecting public health and the quality of life in the city. Water bodies and wetlands around Dhaka are facing destruction as these are being filled up to construct multi-storied buildings and other real estate developments. Coupled with pollution, such erosion of natural habitats threatens to destroy much of the regional biodiversity.     Parks and lakes   There are many parks within Dhaka city, including Ramna Park, Suhrawardy Udyan, Shishu Park, National Botanical Garden, Baldha Garden, Chandrima Uddan, Gulshan Park and Dhaka Zoo. There are lakes within city, such as Crescent lake, Dhanmondi lake, Baridhara-Gulshan lake, Banani lake, Uttara lake and Hatirjheel-Begunbari lake.  Hatirjheel-Begunbari is a new place of recreation for city dwellers. Hatirjheel covering  is transformed into a place of festivity at night but with serenity settling down. Consultants from Civil Engineering Department of BUET and engineers of SWO of Bangladesh Army, Roads and Highways Department, Local Government Engineering Department and Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha have worked hard to turn this project into reality.   Government  Civic administration The Dhaka municipality was founded on 1 August 1864, and upgraded to corporation status in 1978. The Dhaka City Corporation is a self-governing corporation which runs the affairs of the city. Recently (i.e. 2011), Dhaka City Corporation has been divided into two administrative parts  these are (1) Dhaka City Corporation-North and (2) Dhaka City Corporation-South  for ensuring better civic facilities. These two corporations are headed by two administrators. The incorporated area is divided into several wards, which have elected commissioners. The Dhaka Education Board is responsible for administering all public schools and most private schools with the exception of English-medium schools and madrassahs. All madrassahs in Bangladesh are governed by a central board while English-medium schools are under separate educational and governance structures.  The Dhaka Metropolitan Police (DMP) was established in 1976 and has 6,000 personnel in 12 police stations. With the rapid growth of the city, the force has been raised to 26,661 personnel and the establishment of 49 police stations has been completed.  To fight rising traffic congestion and population, the national government has recently implemented a policy for rapid urbanization of surrounding areas and beyond by the introduction of a ten-year relief on income tax for new construction of facilities and buildings outside Dhaka.

Water management     Aside from Chittagong, Dhaka has a water-borne sewage system, but this serves only 22% of the population while another 30% are served with septic tanks. In 2011 Bangladeshs capital development authority, Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK), made rainwater harvesting for new houses mandatory in an effort to address water scarcity and reduce flooding.  82% of the citys water supply is abstracted from groundwater through 577 deep tube wells, while four relatively small surface water treatment plants provide the remaining 18%. Groundwater levels are dropping at two to three metres every year. The citys water table has sunk by 50 metres in the past four decades and the closest underground water is now over 60 metres below ground level. The Asian Development Bank estimated in 2007 that by 2015 a severe supply shortage would occur if the utility did not reduce groundwater abstraction. Nevertheless, DWASA announced in 2012 that it will develop a new wellfield with 46 wells providing  of water per day at a cost of  of which  will be financed by the government of South Korea.  The utility plans to substitute surface water for groundwater through the construction of four large water treatment plants until 2020 at a cost of  (Saidabad Phase II and III, Padma/Pagla and Khilkhet). The treatment plants will draw water from more distant and less polluted rivers up to  from the city. The four plants are expected to have a combined capacity of  per year, compared to a 2010 supply of  per year that is mainly from groundwater. , funding had been secured for the first plant which is under construction thanks to a  contribution from Danish development assistance. In 2012 the government signed a contract with a Chinese company to build a water treatment plant at Munshiganj on the Padma River. The project costs  of which  is financed by a soft loan from the Chinese government, the remainder coming from the Bangladeshi government.
